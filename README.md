# Applied-Visualization-for-Climate-Data-using-Python
#In this project , I used a climate dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website (www.ncdc.noaa.org) to 
#visualize correlation between Avg. rainfall and Avg. Temperature for Monthly Data between 1901 and 2012 by conforming Tufte’s and 
#Cairo’s visualization principles.


#In this project , I have incorporate principles , such as having as high data-ink ratio (Tufte) and aligning with Cairo’s principles
#of truth, beauty, function, and insight.
